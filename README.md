                        INTRODUCTION OF LINUX


Hacking is the most important skill set of the 21st century! I don’t make
that statement lightly. Events in recent years seem to reaffirm this
statement with every morning’s headline. Nations are spying on each
other to gain secrets, cyber criminals are stealing billions of dollars,
digital worms demanding ransoms are being released, adversaries are
influencing each other’s elections, and combatants are taking down each
other’s utilities. These are all the work of hackers, and their influence
over our increasingly digital world is just beginning to be felt.
I decided to write this book after working with tens of thousands of
aspiring hackers through Null-Byte, https://www.hackers-arise.com/, and
nearly every branch of the US military and intelligence agencies (NSA,
DIA, CIA, and FBI). These experiences have taught me that many
aspiring hackers have had little or no experience with Linux, and this
lack of experience is the primary barrier to their starting the journey to
becoming professional hackers. Almost all the best hacker tools are
written in Linux, so some basic Linux skills are a prerequisite to
becoming a professional hacker. I have written this book to help
aspiring hackers get over this barrier.
Hacking is an elite profession within the IT field. As such, it requires
an extensive and detailed understanding of IT concepts and
technologies. At the most fundamental level, Linux is a requirement. I
strongly suggest you invest time and energy into using and

understanding it if you want to make hacking and information security
your career.
This book is not intended for the experienced hacker or the
experienced Linux admin. Instead, it is intended for those who want to
get started along the exciting path of hacking, cybersecurity, and
pentesting. It is also intended not as a complete treatise on Linux or
hacking but rather a starting point into these worlds. It begins with the
essentials of Linux and extends into some basic scripting in both bash
and Python. Wherever appropriate, I have tried to use examples from
the world of hacking to teach Linux principles.
In this introduction, we’ll look at the growth of ethical hacking for
information security, and I’ll take you through the process of installing a
virtual machine so you can install Kali Linux on your system without
disturbing the operating system you are already running.


What is Ethical Hacking?
With the growth of the information security field in recent years has
come dramatic growth in the field of ethical hacking, also known as
white hat (good guy) hacking. Ethical hacking is the practice of
attempting to infiltrate and exploit a system in order to find out its
weaknesses and better secure it. I segment the field of ethical hacking
into two primary components: penetration testing for a legitimate
information security firm and working for your nation’s military or

intelligence agencies. Both are rapidly growing areas, and demand is
strong.
Penetration Testing
As organizations become increasingly security conscious and the cost of
security breaches rises exponentially, many large organizations are
beginning to contract out security services. One of these key security
services is penetration testing. A penetration test is essentially a legal,
commissioned hack to demonstrate the vulnerability of a firm’s network
and systems.
Generally, organizations conduct a vulnerability assessment first to
find potential vulnerabilities in their network, operating systems, and
services. I emphasize potential, as this vulnerability scan includes a
significant number of false positives (things identified as vulnerabilities
that really are not). It is the role of the penetration tester to attempt to
hack, or penetrate, these vulnerabilities. Only then can the organization
know whether the vulnerability is real and decide to invest time and
money to close the vulnerability.

Why Hackers Use Linux

So why do hackers use Linux over other operating systems? Mostly
because Linux offers a far higher level of control via a few different
methods.
Linux Is Open Source
Unlike Windows, Linux is open source, meaning that the source code
of the operating system is available to you. As such, you can change and
manipulate it as you please. If you are trying to make a system operate
in ways it was not intended to, being able to manipulate the source code
is essential.
Linux Is Transparent
To hack effectively, you must know and understand your operating
system and, to a large extent, the operating system you are attacking.
Linux is totally transparent, meaning we can see and manipulate all its
working parts.
Not so with Windows. Microsoft tries hard to make it as difficult as
possible to know the inner workings of its operating systems, so you
never really know what’s going on “under the hood,” whereas in Linux,
you have a spotlight shining directly on each and every component of
the operating system. This makes working with Linux more effective.
Linux Offers Granular Control
Linux is granular. That means that you have an almost infinite amount
of control over the system. In Windows, you can control only what
Microsoft allows you to control. In Linux, everything can be controlled
by the terminal, at the most miniscule level or the most macro level. In
addition, Linux makes scripting in any of the scripting languages simple
and effective.
